  <h1>Huawei demo - WORK IN PROGRESS</h1>

  <p>This demo works best in Chrome, Firefox or Opera. <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia">Safari and IE don't support the camera API</a>, unfortunately.</p>
  <p>The same codebase can produce an iOS app though, which has full camera support, so the above limitations for iOS aren't that relevant.</p>
  <p>Code and README are <a href="https://github.com/dandv/instagram-clone">on GitHub</a>.</p>
  <p>There are more features than meet the eye. Check out the README!</p>
